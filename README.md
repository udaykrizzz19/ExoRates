## üîó API-referencia

This project uses the [**Fawazahmed0 Currency API**](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api), which provides up-to-date and historical currency exchange rates. It's a free and open-source API with no rate limits.

---

## üîÆ J√∂v≈ëbeni fejleszt√©sek

While the current version is fully functional, here are some ideas for future enhancements:

-   [ ] **Historical Data Charts**: Visualize currency trends over time using a charting library.
-   [ ] **Favorite Currencies**: Allow users to save their most-used currency pairs for quick access.
-   [ ] **Offline Support**: Cache the latest exchange rates using a Service Worker for offline functionality.
-   [ ] **Cryptocurrency Support**: Extend the app to include conversions for major cryptocurrencies.
